2.
The result that has the smallest error on the testing data is WSPM

3.
Overfitting refers to a model that models the training data too well. Since we use a lot of data in this training, it is unlikely to have overfitting. We have a good training model for singe regression as there is no extremely low training error but a high testing error.

An underfitting machine learning model will have poor performance on the training data and test data. In this case, our multiple regression is underfit.
