Air Pollution Predictor:

Tensorflow version: v1

To run the program simply run the python code either for simple_regression_model.py or mutiple_regression_model.py. 

How to run in terminal:

1.go the the project directory "AirPollutionPredication" 

2.run 'python Code/{filename}'

For simple_regression_model, we use polynomial regression model with degree 3 to predict PM2.5 by TEMP, PRES, DEWP, RAIN, wd, and WSPM.

For mutiple_regression_model, we use linear regression model to predict.
